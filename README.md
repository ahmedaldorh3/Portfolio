# Ahmed Khaled Mohamed – Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project portfolio. I am a **Data Scientist**, **Data Analyst**, and **Computer Vision Engineer** with hands-on experience in building end-to-end data-driven solutions. My work spans applied machine learning, statistical analysis, computer vision pipelines, and business intelligence.

A large portion of my professional Computer Vision and OCR work is **confidential** due to company restrictions; however, the public projects below reflect the breadth of my skills, methodologies, and practical experience across real-world and simulated environments.

## About Me

I have worked extensively on advanced machine learning initiatives, computer vision workflows, and data analysis tasks in both academic and industry settings. My background includes numerous **scholarships, intensive training programs, and practical courses** that involved real applied work, hands-on projects, and collaborative problem-solving.

I am experienced in:

- Building machine learning and deep learning models  
- Converting unstructured data into structured datasets  
- Designing dashboards and business insights  
- Creating full data pipelines spanning collection, cleaning, transformation, and modeling  
- Working with Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and computer vision frameworks

# Featured Projects

## 1. Agritech – Yellow Rust Detection & Advisory System  
**Domain:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Engineering  
**Collaborators:** Ibrahim Hesham  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Shady  

This is one of the most extensive projects I have worked on. I personally visited a specialized agricultural research center in Egypt to **collect raw unstructured data**, convert it into structured form, and build a complete machine learning workflow around it.

The project focuses on detecting **yellow rust disease in wheat** and producing advisory outputs for farmers.  
Only the **final application**, the **structured dataset**, and the **presentation covering all project phases** are included in this repository. Internal models and intermediate files remain confidential.

**Included in repository:**  
- Advisory system application (final output)  
- Final structured dataset  
- Full project presentation

## 2. Café Analytics Case Study  
**Domain:** Data Analysis, Dashboarding  
**Tools:** Excel, PowerPoint  

A case study based on **simulated data from a café in Egypt**, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and dashboard development.  
I built a comprehensive Excel dashboard and delivered a PowerPoint walkthrough covering methods, findings, and key insights.

**Included in repository:**  
- Excel dashboard  
- PowerPoint presentation  
- Simulated dataset

## 3. Bike Store Data Analysis  
**Domain:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Python  
**Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

This project presents a full Python-based data analysis workflow on a bike store dataset.  
It includes cleaning, transformation, trend identification, and insight generation to support decision-making.

**Included in repository:**  
- Bike store dataset  
- Complete Python script for cleaning and analysis

## 4. SquadPick – Handball Squad Prediction System  
**Domain:** Machine Learning, Sports Analytics  
**Collaborators:** Ibrahim Hesham  

SquadPick was my graduation project, developed with my full team, where the machine learning and modeling components were completed by myself and **Ibrahim Hesham**.

The system uses **simulated data for an Egyptian women’s handball team** and applies machine learning techniques to help identify the optimal squad for upcoming matches.

**Included in repository:**  
- Project description  
- Machine learning components  
- Documentation and supporting materials

# Confidential Work (Not Included)

Beyond the public projects shared here, I have developed several advanced **Computer Vision, OCR, and document verification systems** for industry use.  
Due to confidentiality constraints, these projects cannot be made public, but they include:

- OCR pipelines for Arabic documents  
- YOLO-based ID and certificate detection systems  
- Super-resolution, preprocessing, and enhancement models  
- End-to-end AI-driven document verification workflows  

These systems significantly contributed to my expertise in **computer vision engineering**, **OCR**, and **real-world AI deployment**.
